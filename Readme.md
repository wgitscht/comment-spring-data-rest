### Spring Rest Data - Comment Service

with less than 100 lines of (server side) code.

This is a very simple example on how powerful spring-rest-data may be.
In a real world application some effort would be made in checking for authorization (can
e.g. be done with spring-security and json web tokens) data sanitizing (client and server side)
and some nice event handling (e.g. checking for profanity) or posting to a message queue where others may listen.

to start it up:
```
mvn clean install
java -jar target/comment-spring-data-rest-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Frontend:
http://localhost:8082/
